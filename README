<p align="center">
  <b>Version 1.0 (BETA)</b><br>
  Unified desktop application for dataset creation and model training
</p>

## Overview

The **AI Model Training Suite** is a desktop application that streamlines the full vision-ML workflow:

1. **Image Capturing** – connect/preview cameras, capture images, and organize datasets.  
2. **Annotation Tool** – label images with bounding boxes/masks for training.  
3. **Augmentation Tool** – generate robust variants of images and labels.  
4. **Model Training** – configure hyperparameters and train YOLO/segmentation models.

The app provides a consistent dark UI, step progress indicator (Image Capturing → Annotation → Augmentation → Training), and lazy-loading of tools so each module starts fast and independently.

## Features

- **Camera Workspace**
  - Live preview, basic device info, and capture to project folders
  - Graceful fallback if the camera module is not present (Launch button)
- **Annotation**
  - Pluggable annotation UI (loads when tab is opened)
  - Saves label files in standard formats for training
- **Augmentation**
  - Embeds your augmentation wizard/panel or central widget if provided by a `QMainWindow`
  - Supports common transforms while preserving labels
- **Training**
  - One-click start for YOLO/Seg models with your default weights or a browsed checkpoint
  - Streams logs and writes results to a project folder (`runs/` by default)
- **Quality UX**
  - Clean sidebar with centered labels + helpful tooltips
  - Pathway labels centered under the step circles (including the edge steps)
